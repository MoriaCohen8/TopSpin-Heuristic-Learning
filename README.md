# üîÑ Learning Heuristics for TopSpin Using BWA* and Deep Learning

This project implements and analyzes heuristic learning methods for solving the **TopSpin puzzle** using both classical search and deep learning techniques.

## üß© Problem Description: TopSpin(n, k)

TopSpin is a combinatorial puzzle where `n` numbered disks are arranged in a circle. At each step:
- The whole circle can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise.
- A fixed-size segment of `k` consecutive disks can be flipped.

The goal is to reach the sorted configuration `[1, 2, ..., n]` from a given permutation using the smallest number of moves. Each move has the same cost.

## üìö Project Components

### üîπ 1. Puzzle Implementation
A class `TopSpinState` models the puzzle:
- Generates all valid successor states.
- Detects goal states.
- Supports state encoding and comparison.

### üîπ 2. Search Algorithm: Batch Weighted A* (BWA*)
A parallel version of Weighted A* that:
- Expands a **batch of B nodes** at each step.
- Uses a weighted priority `f(n) = g(n) + w ‚ãÖ h(n)`.
- Supports batching for efficient GPU-based heuristic evaluation.

### üîπ 3. Heuristic Learning
Two methods for training neural network heuristics:
- **Bootstrapping**: Learns from the length of paths found by BWA*.
- **One-step Bellman update**: Trains by minimizing the error between a state and the best successor.

Both methods use PyTorch and are trained on random states generated from goal configurations.

### üîπ 4. Empirical Evaluation
The learned heuristics are evaluated using BWA* under different parameters (weight `W`, batch size `B`), and compared to a baseline gap-counting heuristic.

Metrics reported:
- Average runtime
- Average path length
- Average number of node expansions
